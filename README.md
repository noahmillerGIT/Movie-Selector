# Movie-Selector
Im a big movie person. One of the biggest problem I and many others come across when going to select a movie is just that... Selecting the movie! There's so many options! What if it was easier? What if instead of scrolling through multiple apps, and multiple categories, you can simply answer a series of quick multiple choice questions and the perfect movie could be recommended to you?!? 



The goal with this project is to create a dictionary filled with 100+ movies all stored in dictionary with values assigned to them based on genre. So for example, a movie like 'The Prestige' would have values associated with it labeled 'Thriller', 'Science Fiction' and 'Drama'. It could also have the streaming services it currently plays on associated with it as well.




The user would them simply open the app and answer a series of questions.



Example "Would you rather watch a Comedy or Drama?"



If user selects "Comedy", the app would loop through all data and select any movies with the attribute 'Comedy' and set them aside.



Through a series of questions the list could be shortened to just a handful or a single movie recommendation perfectly encapsulating the viewers preference.



Later uploads could also potentially allow the user to prequalify by selecting the streaming service they want to use. It could also grow to include tv series if user is interested on getting hooked on new show.
